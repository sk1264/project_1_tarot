# Tarot Card "Game of Life" 

Discover your fate through a Tarot Card "Game of Life", where the user will walk through 10 major life events to be interpreted by a tarot reading. At the end of the game, depending on whether the majority of readings turn out bad vs. good, you win or lose!

Tarot decks contain 78 cards divided into two major groups:

1. 22 Major Arcana Cards
2. 56 Minor Arcana Cards

The 22 Major Arcana include cards such as The Fool or The World, while the 56 Minor Arcana hold cards like Queen of Wands and Eight of Swords. Essentially, the Major Arcana symbolizes larger events of life, whereas the Minor Arcana represents day-to-day insights.

## MVP Goals:
1. As a user, I am entering the "Tarot Reading Game of Life" where I will endure 10 major life events each dictated by a reading. In order for me to win the game, I need to get 5 or more "positive" readings for each life event. Otherwise, I lose.
2. As a user, I will be presented a 78 card deck at the beginning of each life event that is meant to be shuffled once clicked.
3. As a user, 10 cards will then randomly be generated.
4. As a user, these 10 cards will be placed faced down on the table in the structure of a Celtic Cross Card Spread tarot card reading.
5. As a user, I will click a button to reveal the cards face up.
6. As a user, the order of the cards will reveal the meaning of each cardâ€™s reading in its placement according to the structure in the interpretation section.
7. As a user, in order for me to "win" and get a good reading, I need to get 5 or more "positive" cards. Conversely, if I get 5 or more "negative" cards, I "lose" and my reading is bad.
8. As a user, at the end of the 10 life events, I will receive an explanation of my win or loss based on the number of "positive" or "negative" readings I have received overall.
 
## Stretch Goals:
1. As a user, I will be able to pick my 10 cards from deck instead of generated randomization.
2. As a user, I will be able to see a more detailed reading when hovering over card once revealed.
3. As a user, there will be a set timer for deck to be shuffled and I can see that shuffling in real-time.
4. As a user, there will be cards that sometimes randomly turn upside down to represent "cards reversed", which have a different interpretation.
